# Data
[Raw data] folder contains raw preference and naturalness ratings by rating method (Likert scale, sliding scale, pairwise comparison, or Fast Image Rating Experiment (FIRE))

[Preprocessed data] folder contains post-exclusion preference and naturalness ratings with image scores given by each participant extracted 
        Image score for Likert and sliding scale methods: numerical rating given to each image
        Image score for pairwise and FIRE methods: binary rating indicating that each image was either selected or unselected
        
[Reliability subsets] folder contains average split half reliability, means, and standard deviations calculated with increasing subsets of participants (N ∈ {100, 110, 120, … 300, 310, 320}) over 10,000 iterations
